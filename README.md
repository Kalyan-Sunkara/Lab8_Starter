### Check Questions
1) I would integrate my tests during the point where we run them locally before pushing code. This is because I would not want to put any new code in that would break the preexisting application's functionality. This would help us kep our github code clean and unbroken.
2) No
3) No we would not use a unit test to test the whole "message" feature of an application as there could be many interactions in the transmission of just one messsage, and therefore unit tests cannot truly encapsulating testing interactions
4) Yes, I would use unit testing the test the "max message length" feature since this is a smaller scaled feature specifically tied to one aspect of a feature, that is possibly the size of a function.
